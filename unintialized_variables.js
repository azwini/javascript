// Basic JavaScript: Understanding Uninitialized Variables

/* Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.
a should be defined and evaluated to have the value of 6.
b should be defined and evaluated to have the value of 15.
c should not contain undefined and should have a value of "I am a String!"
*/

var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
